1. User Search Query Handling:
   Task: User initiates a search for jobs with pagination (e.g., requesting 10 jobs).
   Action: Extract query parameters (search text, job type, location, date posted, pagination) from the request.
2. Database Query:
   Task: Query the database first to check if there are any jobs matching the search criteria.
   Action: Perform a SQL query on the jobs table, applying filters (e.g., job title, type, location).
   Action: Return the number of jobs available in the database.
3. Check for Insufficient Results:
   Task: Determine if the number of jobs found in the database is less than the required pagination count (e.g., fewer than 10 jobs).
   Action: If there are enough jobs in the database (equal to or greater than the requested page size), return them to the user.
   Action: If the number of jobs is less than the required count, calculate the shortfall (e.g., if 4 jobs are in DB, fetch 6 more).
4. External API Fetch:
   Task: Fetch the additional jobs from the external API (e.g., Adzuna) to meet the pagination requirement.
   Action: Send a request to the external API with the search parameters (e.g., search text, location, job type).
   Action: Retrieve the additional job data from the API response.
5. Cache API Results to the Database:
   Task: Ensure that the jobs fetched from the external API are stored in the database to avoid redundant API calls in future queries.
   Action: Check for duplicates (using job IDs or unique identifiers) before inserting the new jobs into the database.
   Action: Insert only the new jobs (that donâ€™t already exist in the DB).
6. Return Combined Results to the User:
   Task: Combine the jobs fetched from both the database and the external API.
   Action: Return a response with the total number of jobs required for the pagination (e.g., 10 jobs: 4 from DB, 6 from API).
7. Pagination and Data Flow for Future Requests:
   Task: Ensure the same logic is applied to future pages or search queries.
   Action: As the database grows, progressively reduce the number of external API calls as more data is available locally.
   Action: If the API fails, return only the jobs available from the DB as a fallback option.
8. Optional Enhancements:
   Task: Implement data freshness mechanisms (e.g., TTL for job data) to ensure outdated jobs are periodically refreshed.
   Task: Apply rate-limiting and API call management techniques to avoid overloading the external API during peak usage times.
9. Error Handling and Fail-Safes:
   Task: Handle external API errors gracefully.
   Action: If the API fails, return only the available jobs in the database and notify the user that results may be incomplete.
